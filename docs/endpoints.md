## Deprecated networks 

The ecosystem moved from `Goerli` onto `Sepolia`.

## Schemes

`https` and `wss` are supported.

## Rate limits

Our gateway enforces a rate limit which is set as high as possible for our supporting infra. Most users will never hit this limit. If your application is ingesting on-chain historical data and you hit the limit, [get in touch](support) and we can discuss this.

No per-IP rate limit applies by default. If you need this, for example because you need your API keys to be on the client, [get in touch](support) and we can add one for you.

## Sticky sessions

Requests from the same client IP will be served by the same underlying full node implementation by default. This is to ensure a consistent state from one request to the next.

There are some data ingestion uses cases in which this is not what you want. Please [get in touch](support) if this is you.
